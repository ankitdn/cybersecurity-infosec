# Difference Between Information Security, Cyber Security, and IT Security

People often confuse or confuse three not quite the same concepts:

- 1) Information Security (IS)


- 2) Computer Security, that is, Information Technology (IT) security

- 3) Cybersecurity. 

Several definitions and benchmarks have been published on the Internet. Some of them are not entirely correct. Therefore, we decided to understand this issue and present our vision of these concepts with a retrospective of our 20 years of experience in the field of information security and IT security.

- The areas of security are booming, which is why the terminology has changed over the years. For example, take the concept of audit. It has many different meanings and shades. From setting up event logging and analyzing them to security testing and interviewing personnel to ensure that security requirements are met. When we deal with living, evolving objects like communication languages or IT, ambiguity in terminology is normal. And yet, it makes sense to place some accents.

## 1 - Information Security (IS)
**Information security** , by and large, is the security of any information, including paper documents, voice information, information in people's brains, and so on. This discipline appeared several thousand years ago. That is, conditionally, with the advent of the first encryption algorithms, if not earlier.

Traditionally, this also includes issues of state security, propaganda, censorship, social manipulation, and so on. There are even government information security laws that have little to do with modern IT security.

Also, information security often includes some adjacent areas of security, especially for organizations that actively use IT. It is about physical security, personnel security, security of relationships with third parties, business continuity, etc. As an authoritative example, we will cite the international standard for the management of the security of organizations ISO 27001. The key two words from the title of this standard are “information security,” although the standard itself contains some material outside of purely information security.

> The three “whales” on which information security is based are integrity, availability and confidentiality. These requirements apply not only to electronic information, but also to “paper”, oral, etc.

Thus, information security is the classic name for a discipline that covers a wide range of information security issues and related issues.

## 2 - Cybersecurity

Cyber security or cyber security (no hyphen) is the most controversial term. Many people think that cybersecurity means the same as IT security. Kind of a modern synonym and buzzword. Someone thinks that cyber security is a new level of IT security, linking its appearance with some major incidents or other events. Someone thinks that cybersecurity is the same as information security. So after all, what is cybersecurity - IT security, information security, or something else? Let's figure it out.

- Let's start with cybernetics, because it was this concept, invented by Ampere and developed by Wiener, that gave the name not only to cyber security, but to the entire modern cyber culture. It is noteworthy that the phrase “cyber security” has not yet caught on. It looks like a ridiculous major's attempt to recreate a non-existent scientific name from the generally accepted short. Like, "guard watch" or "epic explosion center".

> Cybernetics, by definition, is the discipline of information in complex control systems. For example, in a computer, person or society. Therefore, cybersecurity can mean the security of information in complex control systems. At the same time, such security itself is a complex control subsystem. Therefore, in any case, it comes down to security management.

In other words, when we use the word “cyber” in conjunction with the word “security”, which means in Greek “helmsman on a ship” or “government”, we are talking primarily about “taxiing,” that is, security management.

It turns out that, strictly speaking, the closest thing to the concept of cyber security is the concept of an information security management system in the understanding of the same ISO Standard. That is, it is a set of processes and security controls for an organization.

In practice, unfortunately or fortunately, cybersecurity is understood as a wide variety of sets of questions. From narrow, like CTF competitions, protecting against certain types of threats or incident investigations, to broader ones, like applying configuration standards and security hardening. Time will show how this concept will develop.


## 3 - Information Technology (IT) Security

**IT security (computer security, digital security, IT security)** - everything is clear here. Protection against hackers, viruses, spam, phishing and many other threats originating mainly from the Internet. This protection is most often implemented by reducing certain organizational or technical security vulnerabilities.

In more formal terms, IT security is about ensuring the integrity, availability, confidentiality and other security requirements for computing and communications technology and the information that it stores, processes and sends.

However, once we begin to understand IT security a little deeper, there are many related tasks, such as protecting against social engineering, managing security performance, providing security assurances, compliance with security regulations, insuring information risks, ensuring business continuity, and dozens of similar tasks.

These tasks no longer fit into purely IT security, and require the competencies of economists, managers, lawyers, financiers, psychologists, teachers and some other professions. It may seem to some that these professions are not so technologically advanced, and, as it were, are secondary in safety. But when you look at it, security is all about risk management. And what to do with the risks is ultimately decided by economics and mathematics.

Thus, IT security, moving to the level of competent system management, sooner or later, again comes down to information security in the understanding of the ISO 27001 standard (see paragraph 1 above).
