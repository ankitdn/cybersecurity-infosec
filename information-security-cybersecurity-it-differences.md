# Difference Between Information Security, Cyber Security, and IT Security

People often confuse or confuse three not quite the same concepts:

- 1) Information Security (IS)

- 2) Computer Security, that is, Information Technology (IT) security

- 3) Cybersecurity. 

Several definitions and benchmarks have been published on the Internet. Some of them are not entirely correct. Therefore, we decided to understand this issue and present our vision of these concepts with a retrospective of our 20 years of experience in the field of information security and IT security.

- The areas of security are booming, which is why the terminology has changed over the years. For example, take the concept of audit. It has many different meanings and shades. From setting up event logging and analyzing them to security testing and interviewing personnel to ensure that security requirements are met. When we deal with living, evolving objects like communication languages or IT, ambiguity in terminology is normal. And yet, it makes sense to place some accents.

## 1 - Information Security (IS)
## 2 - Cybersecurity
## 3 - Information Technology (IT) Security
