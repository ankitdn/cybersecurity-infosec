# Difference Between Information Security, Cyber Security, and IT Security

People often confuse or confuse three not quite the same concepts:

- 1) Information Security (IS)

- 2) Computer Security, that is, Information Technology (IT) security

- 3) Cybersecurity. 

Several definitions and benchmarks have been published on the Internet. Some of them are not entirely correct. Therefore, we decided to understand this issue and present our vision of these concepts with a retrospective of our 20 years of experience in the field of information security and IT security.

- The areas of security are booming, which is why the terminology has changed over the years. For example, take the concept of audit. It has many different meanings and shades. From setting up event logging and analyzing them to security testing and interviewing personnel to ensure that security requirements are met. When we deal with living, evolving objects like communication languages or IT, ambiguity in terminology is normal. And yet, it makes sense to place some accents.

## 1 - Information Security (IS)
## 2 - Cybersecurity

Cyber security or cyber security (no hyphen) is the most controversial term. Many people think that cybersecurity means the same as IT security. Kind of a modern synonym and buzzword. Someone thinks that cyber security is a new level of IT security, linking its appearance with some major incidents or other events. Someone thinks that cybersecurity is the same as information security. So after all, what is cybersecurity - IT security, information security, or something else? Let's figure it out.

- Let's start with cybernetics, because it was this concept, invented by Ampere and developed by Wiener, that gave the name not only to cyber security, but to the entire modern cyber culture. It is noteworthy that the phrase “cyber security” has not yet caught on. It looks like a ridiculous major's attempt to recreate a non-existent scientific name from the generally accepted short. Like, "guard watch" or "epic explosion center".

> Cybernetics, by definition, is the discipline of information in complex control systems. For example, in a computer, person or society. Therefore, cybersecurity can mean the security of information in complex control systems. At the same time, such security itself is a complex control subsystem. Therefore, in any case, it comes down to security management.

In other words, when we use the word “cyber” in conjunction with the word “security”, which means in Greek “helmsman on a ship” or “government”, we are talking primarily about “taxiing,” that is, security management.

It turns out that, strictly speaking, the closest thing to the concept of cyber security is the concept of an information security management system in the understanding of the same ISO Standard. That is, it is a set of processes and security controls for an organization.

In practice, unfortunately or fortunately, cybersecurity is understood as a wide variety of sets of questions. From narrow, like CTF competitions, protecting against certain types of threats or incident investigations, to broader ones, like applying configuration standards and security hardening. Time will show how this concept will develop.


## 3 - Information Technology (IT) Security
